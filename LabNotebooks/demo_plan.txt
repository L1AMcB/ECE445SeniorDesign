Plan for the demo:

Show the program and the paddle and explain how everthing works

demonstrate the funcitonality by:

 - simple kicks and punches to show the force measurement

 - kicks at roughly the same force level to show consistency in the measurements

 - show inaccurate kicks are measured properly as well, by kicking the paddle poorly and showing the accuracy

 - show the mini games and traning modes to show the funcitonality of the paddle and the program

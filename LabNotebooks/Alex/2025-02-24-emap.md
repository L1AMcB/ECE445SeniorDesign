&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our proposal review on the 18th went pretty well. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 21st, our TA Jason reached out to us with feedback about our proposal review. There were some minor mistakes we made here and there, but the biggest ones were "not quantifying our first high level requirement with force", "having *optional* features for our project", "not having enough details for our sensing subsystem", and "not having a detailed *Tolerance Analysis* section."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fixed our project proposal accordingly, addressing all the points from the feedback. We also finalized our design and decided to go with a small sensor array layout on the paddle. Moreover, we also finalized the exact parts to use for our all our subsystems. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some thoughts and discussion with Liam, we decided to remove the LED component of our project. The LED strips attached around the paddles were going to act as indicators for "good" strikes on the paddle, or for aiding our training regimen, such as reaction speed training sessions. However, with out external display and speakers planned, we concluded that the LED was going to be redundent; the display and speakers will be able handle our goals just as fine, if not better, than the LEDs.

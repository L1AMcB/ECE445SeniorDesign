&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we finished laying out our components on the PCB and making all the wire connections. The PCB turned out to be just around 10cm x 10cm, which is quite ideal. The wirings where pretty complicated and tedious in terms of labor, so Liam and I took turns making progress and cross-validated the connections so that our PCB wouldn't get up being faulty. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily, I realized that our connections for the potentiometers in the flexiforce handler section was wrong. Unlike the diagram above, we used port 2 as one of the inputs and the other as output. Apparently, port 2 should strictly be used as the output.

# Introduction

## Problem:

Taekwondo is a Korean martial art and combat sport involving primarily kicking techniques and punching. When athletes train, they utilize what are called "paddles," equipments that are analogous to mitts in boxing. Athletes repeatedly hit the paddles to train their kicks and various strikes, and it is usually up to the holder to determine whether it was a good kick, or the athletes themselves will decide whether the kick was "satisfactory" or not. Currently there is no good way to accurately quantify performance in Taekwondo training for drills such as speed and power. There exists electronic gear called "Daedo gear" for automatic scoring by tracking the power and the location of the martial artistsâ€™ kicks, but that gear is only used in competition and is prohibitively expensive, unrealistic both for everyday trianing and for accomodating every athlete. 

## Solution: 

To solve the issue of accessibility, cost, and overall quality of training for athletes, we are proposing electronic target paddles. Our prototype will include pressure sensors at different locations of the paddle to measure power and speed for kicking during training. The paddle must be lightweight and flexible, which necessitates minimal attachments to the paddle itself, encouraging the use of a wrist attachment to handle the majority of the functionality and connections. We will also facilitate reaction speed/timing drills via sound or blinking of the LEDs. Example paddle here:

We would have our main system (pcb) be a separate box that would handle the inputs from the paddles through a bluetooth connection. Then using the information received from the strikes of the athlete, our prototype will output the results and statistics to an external monitor or and LCD screen.

## High-level requirements list: 

1. System must be able to accurately differentiate between different strength strikes to the paddle. 

2. Added weight to the paddle must not exceed 2 punds so that the kicker can safely strike the paddle, and so the holder doesn't have to work noticably harder than before to use the paddle.

3. Paddle must be able to last on it's own power for more than thirty minutes.

# Ethics and Safety

We see no ethics concern with this type of technology. However in terms of safety, no one should attempt the Taekwondo techniques if they are not already experienced, or are being guided by someone who is.

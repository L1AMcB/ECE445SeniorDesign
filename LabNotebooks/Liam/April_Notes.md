4/6:

We have soldered almost all of the parts to our board, except for a few resistors and capacitors that the supply center and self service didn't end up having. 

We have gotten our paddle back from the machine shop and have our sensors ready to wire to our board. 


4/13:

we have successfully programmed our board, and we are able to read from it as well. All of our tests up until this point have passed. 

We are now waiting for our finals parts and will be able to test the full functionality of the baord.

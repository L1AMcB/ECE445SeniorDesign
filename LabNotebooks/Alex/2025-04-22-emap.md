&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCB has been fully soldered since our componenets all arrived a couple days ago. The soldering oven made the work a lot easier, but we still had to double check all our solders for bridging since some of our parts are less than 3mm in dimensions. Many of the capacitors at the self service shop were unlabelled, which is quite inconvenient, so we had to bring a little bit of all to the lab upstairs and measure the capacitance with an LCR meter. Funnily enough, we clipped the legs of the breadboard buttons and manually soldering them on to the PCB for testing and powering on the ESP32 program. This worked perfectly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later this week, we also received our paddle design from the mechanical shop. We are very grateful that they helped us bore holes through our paddle for the flexiforce sensors to go through. So we put the flexiforce sensors through our paddle and start testing.

NOTEBOOK ENTRIES:

Each complete entry should include:

Date
Brief statement of objectives for that session
Record of what was done

The record will include equations, diagrams, and figures. These should be numbered for reference in the narrative portion of the book. Written entries and equations should appear on the right-hand page of each pair. Drawn figures, diagrams, and photocopies extracted from published sources should be placed on the left-hand side, which is graph-ruled. All separate documents should be permanently attached to the notebook. All hand-written entries must be made in pen.

Overall, the book should contain a record that is clear and complete, so that someone else can follow progress, understand problems, and understand decisions that were made in designing and executing the project.

What to include:

 - The main ideas from your project proposal.
 - Bibliographic references for any materials that are used as sources. Many of these references will be needed in the written report, later.
 - Diagrams, schematic, and/or block diagrams for any hardware which is designed and/or tested. There should be an accompanying discussion explaining the principle design problems and decisions. Proposed tests should be described as well.
 - Equations and formulas used in the design process, along with a reference to their sources. If derived by you, sketch enough of the development so that someone can follow the idea from your notes.
 - Documentation of the testing and debugging process. This includes notes of what is being checked, test set-up diagrams, and non-routine results. Difficulties should be noted with particular care.
 - It is wise to note anything of any conceivable importance when dealing with debugging problems. Test-signal amplitudes, waveforms, frequencies, modulation types and amounts, test connections, meter scale settings and readings, sketches or printouts of waveforms from precisely identified points in the circuit, and power supply values, are examples. Consider everything you would need to know to reproduce your test and results.
 - Analysis of, and proposed solutions for, any debugging problems. Include all revisions of diagrams and test setups and any new equations, etc.
 - Documentation of the new tests, as before.
 - Documentation of final performance tests and design verification.
 - Topic outlines for oral and/or written reports can reasonably be included.

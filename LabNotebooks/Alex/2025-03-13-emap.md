&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we designed our wrist wearable component's pcb. We designed the schematic while referring to the ECE445 wiki and other materials off the internet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below you can the see the circuit layout schematic. Most of the parts were from the provided bare minimum circuit layout for the ESP32 to work and to be programmed. The only parts we added are the step-down converter TPS62933O circuit from our 9V battery to the 3.3V for the ESP32, the step-up converter MT3608 circuit from the 3.3V to 5V for our Flexiforce sensors, and the Flexiforce sensor circuit. Thinking back at it, it may have to more consistent to use two step-down converters to step down from 9V to both 3.3V and 5V--but I don't think it makes that big of a difference.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we were working on this schematic, it raised three questions about the circuit design: how exactly does the voltage divider work, how exactly do decoupling capacitors work, and how does a step-up converter work? I learned voltage divider logic is one of my early EE classes, but it was nice to review it and think through it again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the voltage divider equation that steps down from the V<sub>in</sub> to the V<sub>out</sub>. The equation can be derived by using node analysis and setting the current flowing through Z<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub>. I had my initially inquires on what the purpose of the Z<sub>2</sub> resistor is, but if you think about how it changes the equation, you can easily figure it out. Increasing Z<sub>1</sub> obviously decreases V<sub>out</sub> since it becomes difficult for current to flow. Increasing Z<sub>2</sub> is a little harder to imagine due to the nature of how the eqation is set, but if you rewrite the equation so that the resistor ratio is (1/(1+Z<sub>1</sub>/Z<sub>2</sub>)), you see that increasing Z<sub>2</sub> brings the voltage of V<sub>out</sub> closer and closer to the voltage of V<sub>in</sub>. Intuitively speaking, increasing Z<sub>2</sub> means that current is limited towards ground and it will have the tendency to flow to V<sub>out</sub> more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told by the internet that decoupling capacitors are "used to reduce noise and voltage spikes within a circuit by providing a local source of energy to power supply pins." This captures why we need those capacitors next to our important parts taking in a certain fixed voltage, but I wanted to know how its accomplishing that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned above, decoupling capacitors act like a local energy reservior. A sudden switch by the IC can pull a spike of current, thereby momentarily dropping the voltage, then the capacitor will discharge and supply current to the IC while the supply catches up. This is possible due to the capacitors being *physically* closer to the IC than the voltage supply--it has a lower impedance path and is able to react to faster switching currents better. Next, the reason for needing multiple capacitors of different capacitance is to cover various frequencies ranges. Smaller capacitance react much faster to higher frequencies and bigger capcitance react better to lower frequencies. Additionally, smaller capacitance capacitors are placed physcially closer to the IC than bigger capacitance capacitors, because they react much faster but for shorter path lengths.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our PCB layout schematic. We have yet to organize all the components and all the wirings. We will get to it soon.

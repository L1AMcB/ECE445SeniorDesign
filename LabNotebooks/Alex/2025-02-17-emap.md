&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposal review is coming up on the 18th, and that is when we present our project idea for the first time to our TA and professors of the class. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our idea is mostly solidified, although we have yet to figure out the fine details... Though, our biggest problem was figuring out exactly what parts we are going to use, but we got that figured out at least. We did some research on the internet, and with the help of ChatGPT, we were able to write up a decent parts list. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past couple weeks, Liam and I have been brainstorming ideas for what sensor to use and what mechanism to use for measuring the force of the kicks. We decided the *FlexiForce Sensor* would be our best bet (although quite expensive), since it is a very flimsy force sensor, which is most desirable for enduring strong, repeated kicks. The mechanism we decided to employ for measuring the most accurate and constructive readings is having an array of sensors placed on the paddles. This way we can measure exactly which part of the paddle was hit, and how efficiently the power of the kick was focused on one area without it being dispersed to other areas of the paddle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we ordered our force sensor, called *FlexiForce*. It is a resistive force sensor that can measure up to 100lbs. A kick in Taekwondo far exceeds 100lbs, but we will implement various mechanisms to tone down the measured force and amplify it back up to the true force. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also planned out what to showcase for our breadboard demonstration coming up in a week. We will use the STM devboard to test out the functionality and the practicality of our FlexiForce sensors.

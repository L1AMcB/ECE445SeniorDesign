&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we worked on our breadboard design to showcase it next week during our breadboard demonstration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main functionality we decided to test was the force measurement of our two FlexiForce sensors concurrently. We referred to the recommended circuit configuration below from the FlexiForce user manual. The manual describes the circuit like the following:
> In this case, it is driven by a -5 V DC excitation voltage.
> This circuit uses an inverting operational amplifier arrangement to produce an analog output
> based on the sensor resistance and a fixed reference resistance (R<sub>F</sub>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the recommended circuit asks for a MCP 6001 Op-Amp, we had a similar LM358N op-amp at hand, which worked perfectly fine for our purposes. Below is the pin configurations of our LM358N.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our final breadboard came out to look like this. The circuit board resting on top is our STM devboard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We connected the breadboard to the STM devboard, which was operated on a software on a separate computer. The breadboard was powered by an external AD-M2KPWR-EBZ, with the ADALM2000â€™s power supplies. The FlexiForce was layed resting on the countertop while we manually pressed down on it, simulating a kick. For calibrations for the true values read through the sensor, we plan to test with various validated weights. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We further tested with a very quick tap, minimzing the actual time in contact with the sensor. We observed that the readings were recorded almost immediately due to the high sampling rate. This test was crucial, because oftentimes a real kick will not be resting on the paddle for too long. Here are the readings through the STM software:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some problems we encountered initially were accidentally connecting the two sensors to the same array of channels on the devboard, resulting in the force readings to influence each other. We solved this by separating the channels within the software program. We were also getting very noisy readings at rest, when the sensors weren't being used, and after some debugging we realized that the devboard had to share the *same* ground as the sensors' ground.
